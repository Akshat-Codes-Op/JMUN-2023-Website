                <h1>Agenda : Deliberating upon the threat of Missile Technologies with special emphasis on Ballistic Missiles and Anti-Missile Defense Systems</h1>
                <p>
                    The accelerated proliferation of missiles has cornered the political leaders
                    into a witness box. Under the guise of building protective armaments, 
                    States continue to accumulate weapons of mass destruction. The Hague Code 
                    of Conduct serves as a mere political agreement encouraging States to 
                    annually report their activities related to missiles. The code fails to 
                    legally bind its signatories and keep a check on them. In all probability, 
                    the demise of global security is just a push of a button away.
                    The advancement of missile technologies increases the chances of
                    destruction by tenfold in the fragile political order that is hanging 
                    by a thread. This year, we invite the delegates to Deliberate, Defend and 
                    Deliver over the increasing proliferation of armaments and blurring lines 
                    between offense and defense.

                <h1>Agenda : Roadmap for the Future of Blockchain Technology
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The G7 Advisory Committee comprises government officials and private representatives that have been tasked with providing the world with a Roadmap For the Future of Blockchain Technology. Blockchain tech aims to revolutionize all existing administrative and financial systems and is already starting to gain traction in its nascent stages. However, its potential threats weigh as heavily as its merits. The search for a perennial and substantial power source to facilitate the existence of cryptocurrencies continues with no evident breakthroughs. The shift to a pseudo world, the metaverse, comes with its own implications and the authenticity of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations remains under severe scrutiny. This new form of technology, under the patronage of private institutions, runs on the idea of decentralisation which goes against the very concept of governance. The battle to reach a middle ground must continue for the holistic development of this world. Delegates must decide- is blockchain the next step in human evolution or a mere fallacy?            </p>

                <h1>Agenda : Discussing the Problem of Authoritarianism in its Varied Forms with Special Emphasis on Safeguarding Democracy
    </h1>
                <p>
                    "The problem to be solved is, not what form of government is perfect, but which of the forms is least imperfect."
    -James Madison
    
    
    The seeds of democracy were first sown in ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE which bloomed into the Athenian Democracy. For the first time, this despotic world witnessed self-rule and was galvanised into reviewing the socio-political system. Since then, the parameters of democracy have undergone profound changes keeping pace with the ever-changing social, economic and political factors.
    Two turbulent millennia later,ent nations to their perquisite and each one considers its model to be superior by forcing it on others. The saga of futile recrimination and retaliation by nations subsists while the onerous task of tackling the volatile socio-economic dilemmas falls upon the shoulders of the citizens.

                <h1>Agenda : Tackling the threats to Peace and Security in the Balkans in light of the Srpskan Revolution of 2025</h1>
                <p>
                    The cross swords between East and West are only strengthened with the passage of time. To stabilise its own, any state’s prestige is put for show in the popular name of ‘collateral damage.’ The Balkan States are old puppets in this mutiny between East and West and therefore, the hope of the United Nations Security Council to be simulated at the Tenth Edition of Jaipuria Model United Nations is that the year 2025 shall be the senectitude of the Balkan-misery at the hands of East and West. A politico-economic crisis in 1991-92 disintegrated Yugoslav beheld to intercept any crisis in the volatile region of Eastern Europe, having failed to prevent the annihilation of Ukraine by Russian Forces in the year of 2022. Ladies and Gentlemen, Serbia, inspired by the Russian Federation, is most resolute on broadening its borders by merging with itself, Republika Srpska. By reason of defective governmental setup, there has been a likewise Sprskan demand to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and declare independence or unite with Serbia. Will this be another show of power politics or this time, the stakes will be different?

                <h1>Agenda : <br> 1)Reviewing the existing electoral framework with special reference to Anti-Defection Law.
                 <br>   2) Addressing the issue of State control over religious institutions</h1>
                <p>
                    Almost 75 years since independence, and some grave issues still plague the world’s largest democratic exercise- Indian elections. With immorality and hypocrisy creeping into the system of elections, fair representation of the people in the legislatures seems to be a pipe-dream. As the contentions over freebies and party-hopping grow, the need to review the Anti-Defection Law, among other things, is greater than ever. India identifies as a secular nation in the Preamble of the Constitution. However, the governments in several states seem to control the management of religious institutions of a particular faith. While some argue for the autonomy of the temples, others see this demand as a bid to divide this country by flaring up communalism. We leave it to you, Parliamentarians, to reflect on the integrity of our Constitution and decide the path ahead.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Immigration to the United States of America is something that has been transpiring for centuries. People wish to move to the ‘Land of Dreams’ to accomplish their dreams and aspirations. The entry of new inhabitants is an ingress of new threats to the country as well. Unfortunately, unscrupulous actions taking place in the name of justice are also a common practice, this is something that manages to tarnish every sphere of the government. A typical example of this in contemporary years is an infamous agency of America, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Violence in dark rooms, separation of innocent children from their parents, and other unthinkable cataclysms, all in the name of ‘security’ have been conspiring for far too long. Now, it is upon the delegates to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver over the tribulations that stand in way of the ‘American Dream’. E Pluribus Unum!

                <h1>Agenda : Assessing contemporary forms of slavery with special emphasis on the 'Hidden Population</h1>
                <p>
                    Slavery is when the sun shines partially on certain men, when the weight of chains in the hands of the slaveholder is heavier than the compassion in their hearts. In this world, if a person descends from a line of slavery, his life is tainted with stigma and lifelong disrespect. The hidden population usually falls victim to such atrocious acts as they are often found in the deep and dark pits of bonded labour and prostitution. Now it is upon the delegates of the United Nations Human Rights Council to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver to scrutinise the reason behind indulgence in such serious forms of exploitation. This year as JMUN marks 10 years into being, we hope the delegates’ moral compass points toward the right direction as they delve deep to annihilate such exploitation from its roots.

                <h1>Agenda : Introduction of Global Media Ethics
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Gone are the days when media was viewed as a local craft by the general public. The existing set of ethics is no longer sufficient for directing the difficulties that global journalism encounters today. The fundamental ethical duty of global journalists in times of uncertainty is autonomous, hard-edged reporting backed by investigations and assessment. Given that journalism is becoming increasingly multimodal in style and global in scope and effect, it is crucial that media ethics examine its core principles, norms, and practices from a more cosmopolitan perspective. At the Tenth Edition of JMUN, the Global Press Summit plans on seeing reporters Deliberate, Defend and Deliver from around the world to form a comprehensive and pragmatic Code of Ethics that can be accepted and implemented globally.
