            <h1>Agenda : Introduction of Global Media Ethics
            </h1>
            <p>
                Gone are the days when media was viewed as a local craft by the general public. The existing set of ethics is no longer sufficient for directing the difficulties that global journalism encounters today. The fundamental ethical duty of global journalists in times of uncertainty is autonomous, hard-edged reporting backed by investigations and assessment. Given that journalism is becoming increasingly multimodal in style and global in scope and effect, it is crucial that media ethics examine its core principles, norms, and practices from a more cosmopolitan perspective. At the Tenth Edition of JMUN, the Global Press Summit plans on seeing reporters Deliberate, Defend and Deliver from around the world to form a comprehensive and pragmatic Code of Ethics that can be accepted and implemented globally.
