            <h1>Agenda : Tackling the threats to Peace and Security in the Balkans in light of the Srpskan Revolution of 2025</h1>
            <p>
                The cross swords between East and West are only strengthened with the passage of time. To stabilise its own, any state’s prestige is put for show in the popular name of ‘collateral damage.’ The Balkan States are old puppets in this mutiny between East and West and therefore, the hope of the United Nations Security Council to be simulated at the Tenth Edition of Jaipuria Model United Nations is that the year 2025 shall be the senectitude of the Balkan-misery at the hands of East and West. A politico-economic crisis in 1991-92 disintegrated Yugoslavia into five successors of the Yugoslav Assets, one of which was the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It comprised two separate legal entities, the Bosnian and Croat dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Serb dominated Republika Srpska. In 1995, Dayton Accords were signed and, through a High Representative appointed by the UNSC resolutions, the international community’s governance of the Republic was established. Later, the Peace Implementation Council successfully conspired to circumvent China and Russia’s Vetoes and install a High Representative that serves the West. In 2025, the UNSC is globally beheld to intercept any crisis in the volatile region of Eastern Europe, having failed to prevent the annihilation of Ukraine by Russian Forces in the year of 2022. Ladies and Gentlemen, Serbia, inspired by the Russian Federation, is most resolute on broadening its borders by merging with itself, Republika Srpska. By reason of defective governmental setup, there has been a likewise Sprskan demand to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and declare independence or unite with Serbia. Will this be another show of power politics or this time, the stakes will be different?
