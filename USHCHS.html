            <h1>Agenda :Reviewing the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in light of the worsening immigrant situation along the US-Mexico Border
            </h1>
            <p>
                Immigration to the United States of America is something that has been transpiring for centuries. People wish to move to the ‘Land of Dreams’ to accomplish their dreams and aspirations. The entry of new inhabitants is an ingress of new threats to the country as well. Unfortunately, unscrupulous actions taking place in the name of justice are also a common practice, this is something that manages to tarnish every sphere of the government. A typical example of this in contemporary years is an infamous agency of America, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Violence in dark rooms, separation of innocent children from their parents, and other unthinkable cataclysms, all in the name of ‘security’ have been conspiring for far too long. Now, it is upon the delegates to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver over the tribulations that stand in way of the ‘American Dream’. E Pluribus Unum!
