            <h1>Agenda : Discussing the Problem of Authoritarianism in its Varied Forms with Special Emphasis on Safeguarding Democracy
</h1>
            <p>
                "The problem to be solved is, not what form of government is perfect, but which of the forms is least imperfect."
-James Madison


The seeds of democracy were first sown in ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE which bloomed into the Athenian Democracy. For the first time, this despotic world witnessed self-rule and was galvanised into reviewing the socio-political system. Since then, the parameters of democracy have undergone profound changes keeping pace with the ever-changing social, economic and political factors.
Two turbulent millennia later, the ambiguity surrounding the definition of democracy persists as citizens solicit their leaders to reach a consensus.
Some States boast about their liberal values while beleaguering people belonging to particular races. They refer to themselves as the symbol of true freedom all the while enlisting intelligent services to wiretap their citizens. Billionaires bereft of morals build their homes on the graves of the oppressed.
On the other hand, some States take pride in their deceptive demagogues dangerously delving into the waters of dictatorship. The chicanery of cadres is concealed while it parries public welfare for the sake of opportunist oligarchs.
Like clay, democracy has been reshaped by different nations to their perquisite and each one considers its model to be superior by forcing it on others. The saga of futile recrimination and retaliation by nations subsists while the onerous task of tackling the volatile socio-economic dilemmas falls upon the shoulders of the citizens.
