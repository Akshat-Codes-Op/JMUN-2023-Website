            <h1>Agenda : Deliberating upon the threat of Missile Technologies with special emphasis on Ballistic Missiles and Anti-Missile Defense Systems</h1>
            <p>
                The accelerated proliferation of missiles has cornered the political leaders into a witness box. Under the guise of building protective armaments, States continue to accumulate weapons of mass destruction. The Hague Code of Conduct serves as a mere political agreement encouraging States to annually report their activities related to missiles. The code fails to legally bind its signatories and keep a check on them. In all probability, the demise of global security is just a push of a button away. The advancement of missile technologies increases the chances of destruction by tenfold in the fragile political order that is hanging by a thread. This year, we invite the delegates to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver over the increasing proliferation of armaments and blurring lines between offense and defense.
