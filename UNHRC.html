            <h1>Agenda : Assessing contemporary forms of slavery with special emphasis on the 'Hidden Population</h1>
            <p>
                Slavery is when the sun shines partially on certain men, when the weight of chains in the hands of the slaveholder is heavier than the compassion in their hearts. In this world, if a person descends from a line of slavery, his life is tainted with stigma and lifelong disrespect. The hidden population usually falls victim to such atrocious acts as they are often found in the deep and dark pits of bonded labour and prostitution. Now it is upon the delegates of the United Nations Human Rights Council to Deliberate, Defend and Deliver to scrutinise the reason behind indulgence in such serious forms of exploitation. This year as JMUN marks 10 years into being, we hope the delegatesâ€™ moral compass points toward the right direction as they delve deep to annihilate such exploitation from its roots.
