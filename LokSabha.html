            <h1>Agenda : 1)Reviewing the existing electoral framework with special reference to Anti-Defection Law.
             <br>   2) Addressing the issue of State control over religious institutions</h1>
            <p>
                Almost 75 years since independence, and some grave issues still plague the world’s largest democratic exercise- Indian elections. With immorality and hypocrisy creeping into the system of elections, fair representation of the people in the legislatures seems to be a pipe-dream. As the contentions over freebies and party-hopping grow, the need to review the Anti-Defection Law, among other things, is greater than ever. India identifies as a secular nation in the Preamble of the Constitution. However, the governments in several states seem to control the management of religious institutions of a particular faith. While some argue for the autonomy of the temples, others see this demand as a bid to divide this country by flaring up communalism. We leave it to you, Parliamentarians, to reflect on the integrity of our Constitution and decide the path ahead.
